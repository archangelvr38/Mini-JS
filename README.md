Hello, viewers!
I admit, I'm one who's not fully into coding like many. It is something that I am learning to enjoy, slowly becoming a favorite hobby of mine.
I work as an Auto Tech, but I'm also a musician. I play sax, bass, and just a hint of piano.
These are multiple projects that I decided to mess around with.
It started with simple HTML and Javascript, but I wanted to add CSS for that nice flavor!
As a rookie, I'm open to suggestions.
Enjoy!
